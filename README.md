This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project. It uses a Compose ui to create a layer-based image editor.

The intended use for the image editor is to develop paramaterized templates for the creation of playing cards, making use of user-provided assets.

This project currently houses a copy of (Keval)[https://github.com/notKamui/Keval]. This is a temporary solution while I try to find an expression evaluation library that can be imported in Kotlin Multiplatform.
